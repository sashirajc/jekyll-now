### Some of the places that I have visited so far
Travelling to places teaches you things that nobody can ever teach you

No matter how far I travel, my home state of Tamil Nadu always evokes a special feeling inside me. A feeling of being in the soil that gave you birth and among the people who you can call your own (by genetic ancestry if not anything else). Changi Airport in Singapore has the same effect despite not being a Singaporean. Something about the airport simply says welcome home and makes me feel like I am where I belong. The conflict of what constitues my home, the land of my birth or the land where I live has dogged me all my life. And while we are pondering on that, let us not forget that we are all nomads passing through our lifetime on earth.

### Wildest thing I have ever done till date
Rented a car at Nadi, Fiji and drove around the main island of Viti Levu. A distance of about 400km covered in 7 hours. With nothing to navigate on except a couple of screenshots of google maps taken on iPad. Nope, no phones, no GPS or a map. The best part, my flight was leaving in about 12 hours. The next flight to Singapore wasn't in 5 days. Best trip ever! Bula Fiji :D
