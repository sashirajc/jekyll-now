I recently tried to try my hand with swift and ios. Got a ios app project from github but I had no idea how to get started. So here are the steps for future reference:

1. Install XCode. It is required to build ios projects

2. Install Cocoa Pods. Follow this stackoverflow question -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20755044/how-to-install-cocoapods

Will add more as I progress through the journey of learning to built ios apps
