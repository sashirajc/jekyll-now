I've finally made the switch from WordPress to GitHub pages!! Yay!

I hated WordPress for the lack of control over how I run my Javascript. And I really wanted a space which will allow me to integrate my code with the blog.

GitHub pages is the answer to all the issues I had.

Looking forward to a more fruitful blogging experience here. If you find anything useful on my blog, please leave a comment. Cheers!
