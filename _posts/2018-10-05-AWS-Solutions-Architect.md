I recently decided to get AWS Certified as a Cloud Solutions Architect - Associate.

[Blueprint for the Cloud Solutions Architect exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)

This post is an overview of the topics covered in the CSA - Associate certification.

AWS Global Infrastructure - 22 Regions and 61 Availability zones

Region - A region is a geographic zone. Each region has atleast 2 availability zones

Availability Zone - A datacenter. These are located in different parts of the same region such that natural disasters in one part of the region will not affect all availability zones at the same time.

Edge Locations - Edge Locations are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content. AWS has 96 edge locations.
